# U-Net_Model_Nuclei_Segmentation

U-Net Model for Nuclei Segmentation (Data Science Bowl 2018)
This repository contains code for a U-Net model trained on the Data Science Bowl 2018 dataset for nuclei segmentation. The dataset provides a diverse collection of segmented nuclei images from various organisms (human, mouse, fly) and serves as a valuable resource for developing and testing image segmentation techniques.

Project Overview:

This project utilizes a U-Net architecture, a popular deep learning model for biomedical image segmentation tasks. The model is trained to accurately segment nuclei in microscopy images, enabling researchers to analyze and quantify these essential cellular components.
